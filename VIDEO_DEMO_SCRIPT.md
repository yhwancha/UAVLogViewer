**[Action: Wait for installation to complete]**

```bash
npm run dev
```

> "Perfect! The development server is now running on localhost:8080. Let's open the application in our browser."

### Section 3: Basic Log Viewing Features (2:30 - 4:30)

**[Screen: Browser - localhost:8080]**

> "Here's our UAV Log Viewer interface. It has a clean, modern design optimized for flight data analysis. Let me show you the basic features first."

> "On the left sidebar, we have the file manager where we can upload flight logs. The viewer supports multiple formats including MAVLink telemetry logs and dataflash logs."

**[Action: Upload a sample flight log file]**

> "I'm uploading a sample flight log. As you can see, there's a beautiful loading animation while the system processes the file."

**[Screen: Loading animation in progress]**

> "The system is now parsing the flight data. This includes extracting telemetry information, GPS coordinates, sensor data, and much more."

**[Action: Wait for loading to complete]**

> "Excellent! The log has been processed. Now we can see the basic flight information displayed here - flight duration, maximum altitude, and vehicle type."

**[Action: Point to flight info display]**

> "The main interface shows various tabs for different types of analysis - we have plots, maps, and most importantly, our AI-powered chatbot."

### Section 4: AI-Powered Chatbot Features (4:30 - 8:30)

**[Screen: Chatbot interface]**

> "Now, let's explore the game-changing feature of this application - the AI-powered chatbot. This isn't just a simple bot; it's a sophisticated flight data analyst that can understand and answer any question about your flight logs."

**[Action: Click on chatbot tab or open chatbot]**

> "Here's our chatbot interface. It has a modern, dark theme that's easy on the eyes during long analysis sessions. Let me demonstrate with some real questions."

**[Action: Type first question]**

> "Let's start with a basic question: 'What was the maximum altitude during this flight?'"

**[Type in chatbot: "What was the maximum altitude during this flight?"]**

> "Watch this - the AI is analyzing the entire flight log data to provide a comprehensive answer."

**[Screen: Show loading animation and response]**

> "Amazing! It not only gave us the maximum altitude but also provided context about when it occurred during the flight. This is because the AI has access to the complete flight data context."

**[Action: Ask another question]**

> "Let's try something more complex: 'Were there any GPS signal issues during the flight?'"

**[Type: "Were there any GPS signal issues during the flight?"]**

> "The AI is now analyzing GPS signal strength, satellite count, and signal quality throughout the entire flight."

**[Screen: Show response]**

> "Incredible! It identified specific time periods where GPS signals were weak and even suggested possible causes. This level of analysis would typically require a flight data expert."

**[Action: Ask about battery performance]**

> "Let's check battery performance: 'Analyze the battery performance throughout the flight'"

**[Type: "Analyze the battery performance throughout the flight"]**

> "The AI is examining battery voltage, current consumption, temperature, and discharge patterns."

**[Screen: Show detailed battery analysis response]**

> "Look at this detailed analysis! It's providing insights about battery health, consumption patterns, and even recommendations for future flights."

**[Action: Try a complex analytical question]**

> "Now let's try something really advanced: 'Were there any anomalies or unusual patterns in the flight data?'"

**[Type: "Were there any anomalies or unusual patterns in the flight data?"]**

> "This is where the AI really shines. It's cross-referencing multiple data streams - accelerometer data, gyroscope readings, GPS positions, motor outputs, and more."

**[Screen: Show comprehensive anomaly analysis]**

> "Fantastic! It detected vibration patterns, identified potential mechanical issues, and even correlated them with specific flight maneuvers. This is the kind of analysis that typically requires specialized software and expertise."

**[Action: Show the resizable/movable popup feature]**

> "One more cool feature - the chatbot can also be used as a resizable, movable popup window. This allows you to have the AI assistant available while examining other parts of the interface."

**[Action: Open popup chatbot, resize and move it]**

> "As you can see, the popup maintains full functionality and even synchronizes with the sidebar chat. You can resize it, move it around, and keep it open while exploring flight data visualizations."

### Section 5: Advanced Analysis & Conclusion (8:30 - 10:00)

**[Screen: Various interface elements]**

> "The system processes an incredible amount of data. In our test case, it analyzed over 1.2 million messages across 66 different message types, covering a 225-second flight with comprehensive telemetry data."

**[Action: Show system processing capabilities]**

> "What makes this truly powerful is the AI's ability to understand context. It doesn't just return raw numbers - it provides insights, correlations, and actionable recommendations."

**[Action: Ask a final complex question]**

> "Let me ask one final question: 'Provide a comprehensive flight safety assessment'"

**[Type: "Provide a comprehensive flight safety assessment"]**

> "Watch as the AI examines every aspect of the flight - from pre-flight checks to landing analysis."
