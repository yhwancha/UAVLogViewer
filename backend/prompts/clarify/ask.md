- Help distinguish between different types of analysis they might want
- Reference specific flight data categories when relevant (altitude, battery, GPS, errors, etc.)

**Question categories to consider:**
- **Scope**: What specific aspect or time period?
- **Detail level**: Summary overview or detailed analysis?
- **Data type**: Which telemetry streams or measurements?
- **Purpose**: Troubleshooting, performance analysis, or general curiosity?

Use the Chain-of-Thought process to understand what the user might be asking for, then provide your clarifying questions. Keep within {word_limit} words.
